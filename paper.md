# Summary

- missingno is a Python package providing a suite of tools for visualizing and 
understanding missing data in a dataset.
- This software is intended to be used for quickly and easily understanding the pattern of
missing entries in a dataset. This makes it useful and applicable to a wide variety of 
problem domains, as datasets are rarely clean enough to not need at least some validating.
- The package is hosted [on GitHub](https://github.com/ResidentMario/missingno).
- I initialized this request due to an email inquiry asking me how best to cite this software
in an academic paper.
